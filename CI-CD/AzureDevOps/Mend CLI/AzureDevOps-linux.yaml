# ******** Mend Unified CLI Template for Azure DevOps ********
#
# You may wish to alter this file to override the build tool and the Mend scanning technologies used (SCA, SAST or Conatiner).
#
# For more configeration options, please check the technical documentation portal:
# ðŸ“š https://docs.mend.io/bundle/cli/page/scan_with_mend_s_unified_cli.html 
#
# ******** Description ********
# Mend SCA will automatically use package managers and file system scanning to detect open source components. 
# Mend SAST will automatically detect languages and frameworks used in your projects to scan for code weaknesses.

name: 'mend-cli-scan'

# Define your own pipeline trigger here:
# Below is defined a trigger for scanning on a push to the main branch and scanning on a push to release branches.  This is considered an ideal time to scan so that an SBOM can be created for software releases and inventory is managed for released software.
trigger:
- main
- release*

pool:
  vmImage: ubuntu-latest

steps:
- script: |

    ### Build the application with your required package manager, e.g: ###
    # - task: NodeTool@0
    # - task: Maven@0
    # - task: NuGetCommand@0
    # - task: Gradle@0
    # - task: PythonScript@0
    # The Mend SCA CLI scan should be called AFTER a package manager build step such as "mvn clean install -DskipTests=true" or "npm install --only=prod"
