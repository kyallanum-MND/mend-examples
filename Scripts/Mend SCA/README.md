<hr/>


## Reports Within a Pipeline

Any report can also be published as a part of the pipeline.  
Add the following snippet after calling the Unified Agent in any pipeline file to save reports from the scanned project to the `./whitesource` logs folder.  
Then use your pipeline's [publish feature](../../CI-CD/README.md#publishing-mends-logs-from-a-pipeline) to save the `whitesource` log folder as an artifact.  

<br>

**Prerequisites:**  

* `jq` and `awk` must be installed
* ENV variables must be set
  * WS_GENERATEPROJECTDETAILSJSON: true
  * WS_USERKEY
  * WS_WSS_URL

<br>

**Execution:**  

```
export WS_PROJECTTOKEN=$(jq -r '.projects | .[] | .projectToken' ./whitesource/scanProjectDetails.json)
export WS_URL=$(echo $WS_WSS_URL | awk -F "agent" '{print $1}')
  #RiskReport-Example
curl -o ./whitesource/riskreport.pdf -X POST "${WS_URL}/api/v1.3" -H "Content-Type: application/json"  -d '{"requestType":"getProjectRiskReport","userKey":"'${WS_USERKEY}'","projectToken":"'${WS_PROJECTTOKEN}'"}'
curl -o ./whitesource/inventoryreport.xlsx -X POST "${WS_URL}/api/v1.3" -H "Content-Type: application/json"  -d '{"requestType":"getProjectInventoryReport","userKey":"'${WS_USERKEY}'","projectToken":"'${WS_PROJECTTOKEN}'"}'
curl -o ./whitesource/duediligencereport.xlsx -X POST "${WS_URL}/api/v1.3" -H "Content-Type: application/json"  -d '{"requestType":"getProjectDueDiligenceReport","userKey":"'${WS_USERKEY}'","projectToken":"'${WS_PROJECTTOKEN}'"}'
```

<br>
<hr>

## [SBOM Report Generation](./sbomreports.yml)

In the above linked example, SPDX and CycloneDX async reports are called from the pipeline.  The reports can be downloaded from the User Interface or retrieved using [additional API requests](https://docs.mend.io/bundle/api_sca/page/reports_api_-_asynchronous.html)

## Adding Red Shield Comment Links to GitHub Issues

[ghissue-eua.sh](ghissue-eua.sh)  

Add the following lines after the Unified Agent command in a GitHub action to add comments to your GitHub issues that are created by the Mend GitHub integration. These comments will indicate if the vulnerability has a red shield and provide a link to the Mend UI for further examination.  

<br>

**Prerequisites:**  

* `jq` and `awk` must be installed
* ENV variables must be set
  * WS_GENERATEPROJECTDETAILSJSON: true
  * WS_USERKEY
  * WS_PRODUCTNAME
  * WS_PROJECTNAME
  * WS_WSS_URL

<br>

**Execution:**  

```
curl -LJO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mend-toolkit/mend-examples/main/Scripts/ghissue-eua.sh 
chmod +x ./ghissue-eua.sh && ./ghissue-eua.sh
```

<br>
<hr>

## Ignoring Alerts Based on Prioritize

[ghissue-prioritize.sh](ghissue-prioritize.sh)  

Add the following lines after the Unified Agent command in a CI/CD pipeline to ignore vulnerabilities based on Mend Prioritize Green shields in a repository that is scanned via the Github Integration.

<br>

**Prerequisites:**  

* `jq` and `awk` must be installed
* ENV variables must be set
  * WS_GENERATEPROJECTDETAILSJSON: true
  * WS_USERKEY
  * WS_PRODUCTNAME
  * WS_PROJECTNAME
  * WS_APIKEY
  * WS_WSS_URL

<br>

**Execution:**  

```
curl -LJO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mend-toolkit/mend-examples/main/Scripts/prioritize-ignore.sh 
chmod +x ./prioritize-ignore.sh && ./prioritize-ignore.sh
```

<br>
<hr>

## Display Vulnerabilities Affecting a Project

[list-project-alerts.sh](list-project-alerts.sh)  

This script can be added to the CI/CD pipeline (or executed independently) following the WhiteSource Unified Agent scan, to list vulnerabilities affecting the last scanned project(s).  

This script parses the `scanProjectDetails.json` file to get the `name` and `projectToken` of the project(s) created/updated during the last scan, and then uses WhiteSource's [getProjectAlertsByType](https://whitesource.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/WD/pages/1651769359/Alerts+API#Project.2) API request to retrieve all the vulnerability alerts associated with that project. It then prints them to the standard output (`stdout`), sorted by severity and optionally color-coded.  

<br>

**Prerequisites:**  

* `jq` and `curl` must be installed
* ENV variables must be set
  * `WS_GENERATEPROJECTDETAILSJSON: true`
  * `WS_USERKEY` (admin assignment is required)
  * `WS_WSS_URL`
  * `WS_UPDATEINVENTORY: true` (defaults to true)

<br>

**Execution:**  

```
./list-project-alerts.sh
```
**Sample Output:**  
```
Alerts for project: vulnerable-node
Alerts: 10 High, 4 Medium, 2 Low

## Display Policy Violations Following a Scan

[list-policy-violations.sh](list-policy-violations.sh)  

This script parses the `policyRejectionSummary.json` file, following a WhiteSource Unified Agent scan, and prints to the standard output (`stdout`) the policies that where violated, as well as the libraries that violated them.  

The `policyRejectionSummary.json` file is created automatically under the agent log directory (`./whitesource`) during a scan that's configured to check policies.  
Every policy check overwrites this file, so this list is always specific to the last scan (that had policy check enabled).  

<br>

**Prerequisites:**  

* `jq` must be installed
* ENV variables must be set
  * `WS_CHECKPOLICIES: true`

<br>

**Execution:**  

```
./list-policy-violations.sh [-p|--includePath]
```
**Sample Outputs:**  
```
$ ./list-policy-violations.sh

## Cache the Latest Version of the Unified Agent

[cache-ua.sh](cache-ua.sh)  

This script allows caching of the [WhiteSource Unified Agent](https://whitesource.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/WD/pages/1140852201/Getting+Started+with+the+Unified+Agent), so you can periodically check for updates and download the latest version only if needed, rather than redundantly downloading prior to every scan.  

The [cache-ua.sh](cache-ua.sh) script can be added to the CI/CD pipeline on a static/hosted build agent (prior to the Unified Agent scan task), or triggered independently, manually or by a scheduled task.  

<br>

**Prerequisites:**  

* `jq` and `curl` must be installed

<br>

**Execution:**  

```
curl -LJO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mend-toolkit/mend-examples/main/Scripts/cache-ua.sh.sh 
chmod +x ./cache-ua.sh && ./cache-ua.sh
```

See additional example for implementation within a build pipeline under [CI-CD](../CI-CD/README.md#caching-the-unified-agent) (`*-cached-ua.yml`).  


<br>
<hr>

## Pending task cleanup

[pending-task-cleanup.sh](pending-task-cleanup.sh)  

This script allows the user to cleanup outstanding [Pending Tasks](https://docs.mend.io/bundle/wsk/page/ui_-_request_history_report_and_pending_tasks.html) in the Mend SCA UI, when this process is no longer required. Please ensure the setting '[Open pending tasks for new libraries](https://docs.mend.io/bundle/wsk/page/ui_-_request_history_report_and_pending_tasks.html)' is disabled under the Integrate, Advanced Settings area. In addition, also ensure that their are no [Policies](https://docs.mend.io/bundle/sca_user_guide/page/managing_automated_policies.html#Applying-Actions-to-a-Library) that are 'Reassign' or 'Condition', which could create new tasks. 

The [pending-task-cleanup.sh](pending-task-cleanup.sh) script is designed to be executed one time per organization to clean up historic pending requests the Mend SCA UI. 

<br>

**Prerequisites:**  

* `jq` and `curl` must be installed
* The tasks within Mend should be assigned to a user and not to a group (Edit policy->Reasssign->Assign to User) as the getDomainPendingTasks API is based off of tasks assigned to a user

<br>

**Execution:**  

```
export MEND_URL=https://saas.mend.io
export WS_APIKEY=x
export MEND_USER_KEY=x
curl -LJO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mend-toolkit/mend-examples/main/Scripts/pending-task-cleanup.sh 
chmod +x ./pending-task-cleanup.sh && ./pending-task-cleanup.sh
```

## Request History Export

[get-request-history.py](get-request-history.py)  

This script exports the product names and their last scan dates to CSV file for reporting purposes, the number of days to query is set as an argument to the script.

**Prerequisites:** 
* Python3.6 and up
* pip install requests csv

<br>

**Execution:** 
python get-request-history.py MEND_URL MEND_APIKEY MEND_USERKEY DAYS_TO_QUERY

<br />
<hr />

# Get all Users that are part of Organizations which are a part of a Global Organization

[get-all-users-under-global-org.py](get-all-users-under-global-org.py)

This script allows a user to retrieve every single user account that is a part of any of their Organizations which reside under the "umbrella" of a Global Organization. This allows an organization to take a full inventory of all users that have access to their resources.

The [get-all-users-under-global-org.py](get-all-users-under-global-org.py) script can be run with Python 3.9+ and utilizes the Mend API 1.4 as well as API 2.0 to get the information necessary.

> **_NOTE:_** If an error occurs with this script that produces an error when attempting to log in via API 2.0, this can happen on a rare occasion. The best thing to do is to implement a more comprehensive retry logic, or just try running the script again.

<br />

**Prerequisites:**  

* `python 3.9+`

**Execution:**
```shell
# Create Environment Variables
export MEND_URL="https://saas.whitesourcesoftware.com"
export MEND_USER_KEY="<userkey>"
export MEND_GLOBAL_ORG_TOKEN="<global_org_token>"

# Run the script
python ./get-all-users-under-global-org.py
```
